  <h2>The Long</h2>
  <p>Hello! My name is Adam Oswalt, and I love all things related to technology and computers. One of my greatest strengths is thinking through problems and finding solid solutions to them. I am continually full of ideas and strive to give them form.
From a very young age, I have been engrossed in computers. I began with using DOS batch files to play games as well as playing around on an NES. Later on, I began to experiment with my own development through things like designing maps in Unreal Tournament and working through a book on Visual Basic 6. I tinkered around off and on, but the concepts continued to stay rooted and develop.
Currently, my development projects tend to be focused around automation and quality of life improvements as I also spend time reading and researching to expand my knowledge and gain experience in an effort to strengthen my programming foundation.
Moving forward, my goal is to pursue my passions of computers and technology. I want to surround myself with knowledgable colleagues to help me grow, and I am continuing to work on personal projects to learn and experiment with new ideas.</p>
