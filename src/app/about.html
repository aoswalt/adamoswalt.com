      <p>Hello! My name is Adam Oswalt, and I love all things related to technology and computers. One of my greatest strengths is thinking through problems and finding solid solutions to them. I am continually full of ideas and strive to give them form.</p>
      <p>From a very young age, I have been engrossed in computers. I began with using DOS batch files to play games as well as playing around on an NES. Later on, I began to experiment with my own development through things like designing maps in Unreal Tournament and working through a book on Visual Basic 6. I tinkered around off and on, but the concepts continued to stay rooted and develop.</p>
      <p>Currently, my development projects tend to be focused around automation and quality of life improvements as I also spend time reading and researching to expand my knowledge and gain experience in an effort to strengthen my programming foundation.</p>
      <p>Moving forward, my goal is to pursue my passions of computers and technology. I want to surround myself with knowledgable colleagues to help me grow, and I am continuing to work on personal projects to learn and experiment with new ideas.</p>
